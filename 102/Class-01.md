## Reading Note Class 1

### Growth Mindset
To me, a **growth mindset** is a mental state of being where one strives to constantly improve oneself, through challenges and obstacles. It is persistent self-improvement through will and effort.

>### 3 reminders to keep a growth mindset
>1. I need to actively *seek out challenges*, and not approach them with the mindset that I cannot solve them. If I'm facing a seemingly impossible obstacle, I need to take a step back and try alternative ways of thinking.
>
>2. There is *no pain, no gain*. I need to be diligent with my work and push ahead with resolve, instead of seeking instant gratification that will lead to regrets later.
>
>3. Be *motivated by others'* accomplishments. What others can do, I can also do with time and effort. I should learn from others' success and try to hone my skills from watching them and working with them. What I cannot do now is just something I can learn as I go.
